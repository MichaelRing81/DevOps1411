# A
first = int(7)
second = float(44.3)
print(first + second)
print(first * second)
print(second % first)

# B
a = 8
a = 17
a = 9
b = 6
c = a+b
b = c+a
b = 8
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# C

# name = "john"
# is the same as
# name = 'john'
# The purpose is to allow the use of " in the phrase.
# Example:
print('I am "very happy" might mean that I am actually not happy at all')

my_number = 5+5
print("result is: " + str(my_number))

# D

x = 5
y = 2.36
print(x+int(y))

# Challenge:

a = 8
b = "123"

print(a+int(b))
